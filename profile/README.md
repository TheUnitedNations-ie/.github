# World Wide Developer Association / 世界开发者联盟

This is a non-profit loose organization for developers (programmers), focusing on making everything better for programmers or the world (Normally titled "developers for developers").  
这是一个基于开发者的松散的非盈利组织，目标是让一切的变得更好（主要是面向开发者或世界）。

* But at the very beginning, maybe only focus on developers in China. It doesn't mean I have bias, I just want to learn how to unite and group others first. You can still ask to join and comment to improve this organization.
* 不过一开始关注的是中国范围内的事情（开发者）。不是因为有偏见，而是我在尝试学习怎么组织和联合。你依然可以加入和评论来改进这个机构。
